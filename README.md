# Cheer

Cheer is an application that provides employers with an easy way to gather employee feedback via their existing Slack work-flows. Employees respond to daily questions in Slack, and their answers are passed through IBM Watsonâ€™s Natural Language Understanding API to identify the emotions and sentiment. This data is then visualized in a web-app so the employer can identify trends in company morale and take corrective actions or celebrate successes.
